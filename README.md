# Amir MOUMEN


Hello my name is Amir, I'm 19yo and I live in France, I'm a developer. I really like to learn new languages and some frameworks like React and React Native, but I also work on Shopify and Wordpress. I enjoy everything related to UI, UX but I give a particular attention for everything related to back-end.
Blockchain maximalist since 2017.
